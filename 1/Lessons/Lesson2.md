# üõçÔ∏è Understanding the Difference Between Programming Languages and Template Languages in Shopify Development

As a **Shopify developer**, it's essential to understand the distinction between **programming languages** and **template languages**‚Äîespecially when working with **Liquid**, Shopify's templating language.

---

## üîß What is a Programming Language?

**Programming languages** such as **JavaScript**, **C++**, **C#**, and **Python** are designed to build fully functional applications and systems. They allow developers to:

* Define **rules and logic** to instruct a computer on what tasks to perform.
* Interact with **APIs**, handle **data processing**, and manage complex **application flows**.

In short, they provide complete control over software behavior and execution.

## üß© What is a Template Language?

**Template languages**, like **Liquid**, are designed primarily to manage **content rendering** within web applications.

They allow you to:

* Embed **dynamic** and **static content** into HTML templates.
* Control how **data from a source** (like a Shopify store) is displayed on the front end.

However, unlike programming languages, template languages have **limited functionality**:

* They **cannot** perform complex operations like API calls or background tasks.
* Their purpose is focused on **presentation**, not logic or interactivity.

---

## üß™ The Case of PHP vs. Liquid

To clarify the distinction further, consider the example of **PHP**:

* **PHP** is a **programming language** that also acts as a **template language** when used in web development.
* Code inside `<?php ?>` tags can execute logic, access databases, and make API calls.
* Outside the PHP tags, developers can write regular **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**‚Äîmaking it versatile.

**Shopify Liquid** works in a similar way, but with tighter restrictions:

* It focuses on **Liquid objects, tags, and filters** to render dynamic data.
* Developers can also include **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in the same file.
* However, **Liquid cannot**:

  * Make API requests
  * Run custom logic beyond its templating scope

## üöÄ When to Use Programming Languages in Shopify

If you need to:

* Make **API calls**
* Perform **custom backend operations**
* Integrate with **third-party services**

...you must build a **Shopify Custom App** or **Private App**, which are developed using **programming languages** like **Node.js** or **Ruby**.
