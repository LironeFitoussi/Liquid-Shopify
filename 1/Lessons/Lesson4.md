# 🛠️ Creating a Shopify Development Store as a Partner

As a **Shopify Partner**, one of the most valuable perks available to you is the ability to create **development stores**. These special stores are designed to support the **design**, **testing**, and **demoing** of Shopify apps and themes in a fully functional Shopify environment.

## 🧪 What is a Development Store?

A **development store** is similar to a live Shopify store but with key differences:

### ✅ Key Features:

* Full access to **Shopify admin and features**
* Ability to **install and test apps and themes**
* No **subscription fees** required

### 🚫 Limitations:

* **Cannot process real payments**
* **Cannot sell products to the public**
* Intended strictly for **development and testing purposes**

You cannot use a development store to make money—it’s a sandbox for building and learning.
